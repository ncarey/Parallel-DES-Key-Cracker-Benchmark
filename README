Thread-Parallel Brute Force DES key cracker in java. Python run scripts for benchmarking performance and octave scripts for graphing benchmark results.

How to Build SealedDES:
    - cd ./source
    - javac SealedDES.java

How to Run SealedDES:
    - build
    - cd ./source
    - java SealedDES <numThreads> <KeyLength>

How to Run Benchmark Script:
    - build SealedDES
    - cd ./scripts
    - python benchSealedDES.py -h
    - examine help information, ensure that you pass the correct path arguments to benchSealedDES.py
    - example: python benchSealedDES.py -p <absolute path to source directory> 
                                        -d <absolute path to data output directory>


Brief comments on code:

   Run the python benchSealedDES.py to generate text benchmark output file. Use this file
   to generate pretty graphs.  Use *.m octave scripts in ./scripts folder to generate these pretty graphs.
   The path variables in these scripts are going to have to be edited in order for them to work on your computer.
   Sorry.
   
   Key of text benchmark file:
   bench.out:
   <number of threads>, <key length>, <key-space size>, <execution time seconds>, <number of keys examined per second>
